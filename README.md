Clear roadmap & deliverables.
cons
Hard to modify once started.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is Best For:
Software with evolving requirements.
Startups & MVP development.
Customer-driven projects .
Waterfall is Best For:
Regulated industries.
Infrastructure or hardware projects.
Fixed-price contracts with clear scope.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
QA ensures the software meets standards, functions correctly, and delivers a positive user experience.
Key QA Methods:
Automated Testing – Unit, integration, and regression tests.
Manual Testing – UI/UX and exploratory testing.
Code Reviews – Peer reviews to maintain high-quality code.
Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) – Automated builds and testing.
Bug Tracking Systems – Tools like Jira, GitHub Issues, and Bugzilla.
Why QA Matters?

Prevents costly errors.
Enhances user satisfaction.
Ensures compliance with security & industry standards.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Why Defining Scope is Important?
Prevents scope creep.
Helps allocate resources efficiently.
Ensures stakeholder alignment.
What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?
A hierarchical breakdown of project tasks.
Helps manage complex projects by dividing them into phases and deliverables.
Example for an E-commerce App:

Frontend Development
UI/UX Design
Product Page Development
Backend Development
Database Setup
API Development
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Project schedule:
Tracks milestones & deadlines.
Improves resource allocation.
Enhances team coordination.
Identifies dependencies to prevent bottlenecks.
How Gantt Charts Help:
Visualize timelines (tasks, dependencies, deadlines).
Adjust schedules dynamically.
Monitor progress at a glance.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
The LandLease App is designed to bridge the gap between farmers and landowners, solving key challenges in land leasing, availability, and transparency in agricultural land use.

Key Problems Addressed:
Difficulty in Finding Land for Farming

Many farmers struggle to locate available land for lease, often relying on word-of-mouth or local networks, which limits opportunities.
Solution: The app provides an interactive map-based listing of available land, allowing farmers to search and filter based on location, size, and lease terms.
Lack of Transparency in Land Leasing Agreements

Traditional land leasing is often informal, leading to disputes over payment, lease duration, and terms of use.
Solution: The app facilitates clear digital contracts between landowners and farmers, ensuring legally binding agreements.
Underutilized Farmland & Idle Land Issues

Landowners with idle or underutilized land may struggle to find tenants, leading to wasted resources and lost income.
Solution: The app allows landowners to list their land, connect with potential tenants, and generate income from leasing.
Limited Access to Verified Land Ownership & Documentation

Farmers often face risks of leasing land from unverified owners, leading to legal issues.
Solution: The app integrates land ownership verification features, ensuring all listings are legitimate and secure.
Lack of Flexible Payment and Lease Options

Many farmers cannot afford large upfront lease payments, and traditional agreements may not accommodate seasonal farming cycles.
Solution: The app provides flexible lease terms and payment options, allowing farmers to lease land on a seasonal, annual, or long-term basis with various payment methods.
Inefficiency in Communication Between Landowners and Farmers

Finding and negotiating leases often involves lengthy back-and-forth communication, making the process inefficient.
Solution: The app offers built-in messaging and negotiation tools, making discussions faster and more structured.
Why These Problems Matter?
For Farmers: Provides better access to arable land, increasing crop production and food security.
For Landowners: Unlocks new economic opportunities by monetizing unused land.
For the Agricultural Sector: Supports sustainable land use, reducing land degradation and improving rural economies.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Prevents feature creep – Keeps development focused.
Ensures user adoption – Solves real pain points.
Improves UX/UI design – Aligns with user expectations.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
The LandLease App is a digital marketplace connecting farmers and landowners, making it easier to lease farmland.
